EulerOnScheme
=============

Solving problems from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) using Scheme to learn this Lisp-dialect.

Motivation
----------

I've already used a (bit of) LISP at my college time, but it was a real lack on my computer science formation.

Once I decided to start studding deep some concepts of computability and history of computation, I found myself on a position where learning LISP or some LISP-dialect is useful (to do not say necessary!).


What I'm using to learn Scheme
------------------------------

Basically I'm using [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and [Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum Days](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_start)

Solved Problems

None yet. I'm a lazy guy!
